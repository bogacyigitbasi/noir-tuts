# Objective

We want to hide the inputs from verifier, simply we want to prove that
we know two variables that has a result of a value. Super pointless example
but it makes sense for a teacher who wants to know if the students completed their
homework. He doesnt care the values, just want to know if its done.

proof generated by `nargo prove`
its verified locally by `nargo verify`

to do that on chain, we will generate a solidity version using nargo.
I am using it like a black box so far, but working on cryptographic primitives
solidity file is generated by `nargo codegen-verifier` this will be used by the original contract
or the contract has some custom logic. In the example, teacher wants to mint a token for students
so be it.
